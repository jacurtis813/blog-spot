# Blog-Spot
This is going to be a challenge excercise to perform independently and then compare the solution to the result of what we have created. Take prior skills learned from the material to apply towards this challenge. 

## Description (How to?)
 
 1. The gray box is actually a border- 20px border. 
 2. This shows that the body will have a border and a width to adjust the sizing of the page. 
 3. The colors used within the challenge will be (border color: #bd3c7; date color: #3498db; h2 color #2c3e50; )
 4. The font style being used is font: source sans pro.
 5. Carefully inspect the content to attempt to duplicate the page as closely as possible.
 6. The dates are all in capitals. Use css to make this change rather than html.
 7. Look for text being aligned, borders, and even proper indentation/ spacing in the page.
 8. Research hr styles and see how to apply the line between the articles.


 ## Breakdown:

1. Created the set up for the HTML to match the content of the challenge web page. 
2. Created content filler with the 'bacon-ipsum'. 
3. Began the mock-up web page. Set the dates in with p tag/ elements.
4. Set the 'bacon ipsum' within a div container. Seperated the content into 3 p elements.
5. Set the border, width and the margin for the body. 
6. Created the single border-left for the first line paragraph per container.
7. Set the class for the dates per each blog date shown in mock-up. 
8. Created comments for the HTML. Clean up and format set.
9. Created comments for the CSS. Clean up and format set-simplify.
10. Set up the second section of the HTML to begin the next article. 
11. Research (how to letter space follow up how to word space). Two seperate properties.
12. Apply the property and the value set for the letter spacing in our dates.
13. Apply the color for the dates along with the spacing.
14. Use google dev-tools to help create the padding for the border-left in the first line paragraphs.
15. Use/ embed the requested font into the document, using google fonts.
16. Apply font changes and the color of those fonts.
17. Research how to add the line in the middle of the page. Found hr. 
18. Apply hr and then apply the styles for hr.
19. Make sure that the HTML and CSS are commented and formatted.
20. Save all work. Comment. Commit. And Compare all work. 

## Additions

1. After comparing we did find another way to give width to the body. We started with the width: 50%. Now we are using the max-width: 700px with the width: 80%. This means the browser will show the page at 700px until it no longer can and then it will do 80% of the 700px.

2. As well we did apply the font-weight property to all the text to make the text that much bolder.

3. Gave margin top and bottom 20px to the body to give some spacing around the border and the top of the web page. 

4. Walk through the differences of em and rem measurements. Using rem to make font-size style changes in the h2 elements.

5. Watch all 3 walk-through videos on the solution for the challenge excercise.

6. Research hr styles. How to style and what they do?

7. Commit and push completed. more.
