This is going to be a challenge excercise to perform independently and then compare the solution to the result of what we have created. Take prior skills learned from the material to apply towards this challenge. 

## Description (How to?)
 
 1. The gray box is actually a border- 20px border. 
 2. This shows that the body will have a border and a width to adjust the sizing of the page. 
 3. The colors used within the challenge will be (border color: #bd3c7; date color: #3498db; h2 color #2c3e50; )
 4. The font style being used is font: source sans pro.
 5. Carefully inspect the content to attempt to duplicate the page as closely as possible.
 6. The dates are all in capitals. Use css to make this change rather than html.
 7. Look for text being aligned, borders, and even proper indentation/ spacing in the page.
 8. Research <hr> styles and see how to apply the line between the articles.


 ## Breakdown:
1. Created the set up for the HTML to match the content of the challenge web page. 
2. Created content filler with the 'bacon-ipsum'. 
3. Began the mock-up web page. Set the dates in with <p> tag/ elements.
4. Set the 'bacon ipsum' within a div container. Seperated the content into 3 <p> elements.
5. Set the border, width and the margin for the body. 
6. Created the single border-left for the first line paragraph per container.
